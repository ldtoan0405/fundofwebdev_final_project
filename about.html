              The goal of this website is to teach those who are interested in
              learning to code the fundamentals of the ten most in-demand
              programming languages. Almost every program is made up of the same
              basic 'building blocks,' which are assembled in a variety of ways
              to achieve a certain goal. Variables, data types, sequence,
              selection, and iteration are just a few of the basic principles
              that all new programmers should be familiar with.
            </p>
            <p>
              My intended audience is new programmers, students, and people from
              many disciplines who are interested in programming, and those who
              haven't made up their minds about their career options are all
              welcome. There will be no limit on experience level, as this will
              be just something to show people the basics of programming.
