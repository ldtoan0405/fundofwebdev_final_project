                        This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the
                        language itself. But we need a working environment to
                        run our scripts and, since this book is online, the
                        browser is a good choice. We’ll keep the amount of
                        browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so
                        that you don’t spend time on them if you plan to
                        concentrate on another environment (like Node.js). We’ll
                        focus on JavaScript in the browser in the next part of
                        the tutorial. So first, let’s see how we attach a script
                        to a webpage. For server-side environments (like
                        Node.js), you can execute the script with a command like
                        "node my.js".
                      </p>
                      <h2>The “script” tag</h2>
                      <p>
                        JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into
                        an HTML document using the &lt;script&gt; tag.
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jshelloworld.jpg"

                      <h1>Code Structure</h1>
                      <p>
                        The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of
                        code.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Statements</h2>
                      <p>
                        Statements are syntax constructs and commands that
                        perform actions. We’ve already seen a statement,
                        alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello,
                        world!”. We can have as many statements in our code as
                        we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.
                        For example, here we split “Hello World” into two
                        alerts:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsstatement1.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Statements 1"
                      />
                      <p>
                        Usually, statements are written on separate lines to
                        make the code more readable:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsstatement2.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Statements 2"
                      />
                      <h2>Semicolons</h2>
                      <p>
                        A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line
                        break exists. This would also work:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jssemicolon1.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Semicolons 1"
                      />
                      <p>
                        Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an
                        “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic
                        semicolon insertion. In most cases, a newline implies a
                        semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!
                        There are cases when a newline does not mean a
                        semicolon. For example:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jssemicolon2.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Semicolons 2"
                      />
                      <p>
                        The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert
                        semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the
                        line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete
                        expression”, so a semicolon there would be incorrect.
                        And in this case, that works as intended.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Comments</h2>
                      <p>
                        As time goes on, programs become more and more complex.
                        It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what
                        the code does and why. Comments can be put into any
                        place of a script. They don’t affect its execution
                        because the engine simply ignores them. One-line
                        comments start with twoforward slash characters //. The
                        rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line
                        of its own or follow a statement. Like here:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jscomments1.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Comments 1"
                      />
                      <p>
                        Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an
                        asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash
                        */. Like this:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jscomments2.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Comments 2"
                      />
                      <p>
                        The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code
                        inside /* … */, it won’t execute.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li class="item">
                    <div style="cursor: pointer">Variables</div>
                    <div class="info">
                      <h1>Variables</h1>
                      <p>
                        Variables Most of the time, a JavaScript application
                        needs to work with information. Here are two examples:
                        An online shop – the information might include goods
                        being sold and a shopping cart. A chat application – the
                        information might include users, messages, and much
                        more. Variables are used to store this information.
                      </p>
                      <h2>A variable</h2>
                      <p>
                        A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use
                        variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data. To
                        create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
                        The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a
                        variable with the name “message”:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvariable1.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Variables 1"
                      />
                      <p>
                        Now, we can put some data into it by using the
                        assignment operator =:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvariable2.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Variables 2"
                      />
                      <p>
                        The string is now saved into the memory area associated
                        with the variable. We can access it using the variable
                        name:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvariable3.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Variables 3"
                      />
                      <p>
                        To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration
                        and assignment into a single line:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvariable4.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Variables 4"
                      />
                      <h1>Variable naming</h1>
                      <p>
                        There are two limitations on variable names in
                        JavaScript: The name must contain only letters, digits,
                        or the symbols $ and _. The first character must not be
                        a digit. Examples of valid names:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvarnaming1.jpg"
                        alt="JavaScript Variables naming 1"
                      />
                      <p>
                        When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is
                        commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each
                        word except first starting with a capital letter:
                        myVeryLongName. What’s interesting – the dollar sign '$'
                        and the underscore '_' can also be used in names. They
                        are regular symbols, just like letters, without any
                        special meaning. These names are valid:
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/jsvarnaming2.jpg"

                      <h1>Constants</h1>
                      <p>
                        To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const
                        instead of let:
                      </p>
                      <img

                      />
                      <p>
                        Variables declared using const are called “constants”.
                        They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would
                        cause an error:
                      </p>

                      />
                      <p>
                        When a programmer is sure that a variable will never
                        change, they can declare it with const to guarantee and
                        clearly communicate that fact to everyone.
                      </p>
                      <h3>Uppercase Constants</h3>
                      <p>
                        There is a widespread practice to use constants as
                        aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known
                        prior to execution. Such constants are named using
                        capital letters and underscores. For instance, let’s
                        make constants for colors in so-called “web”
                        (hexadecimal) format:

                      <p>
                        A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For
                        example, a string or a number. There are eight basic
                        data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in
                        general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each
                        of them in detail. We can put any type in a variable.
                        For example, a variable can at one moment be a string
                        and then store a number:
                      </p>

                      />
                      <p>
                        Programming languages that allow such things, such as
                        JavaScript, are called “dynamically typed”, meaning that
                        there exist data types, but variables are not bound to
                        any of them.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Number</h2>

                      />
                      <p>
                        In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent
                        integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s
                        9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
                        To be really precise, the “number” type can store larger
                        integers (up to 1.7976931348623157 * 10308), but outside
                        of the safe integer range ±(253-1) there’ll be a
                        precision error, because not all digits fit into the
                        fixed 64-bit storage. So an “approximate” value may be
                        stored. For example, these two numbers (right above the
                        safe range) are the same:

                      <p>
                        We know many operators from school. They are things like
                        addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Terms: “unary”, “binary”, “operand”</h2>
                      <p>
                        An operand – is what operators are applied to. For
                        instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two
                        operands: the left operand is 5 and the right operand is
                        2. Sometimes, people call these “arguments” instead of
                        “operands”.<br />

                        An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For
                        example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a
                        number:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same
                        minus exists in binary form as well:

                      <h2>Maths</h2>
                      <p>
                        The following math operations are supported: <br />
                        Addition +, <br />
                        Subtraction -, <br />
                        Multiplication *, <br />
                        Division /, <br />
                        Remainder%, <br />
                        Exponentiation **. <br />
                      </p>
                      <h3>Remainder %</h3>
                      <p>
                        The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not
                        related to percents. The result of a % b is the
                        remainder of the integer division of a by b.

                      <h3>Exponentiation **</h3>
                      <p>
                        The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power
                        of b.

                        Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is
                        defined for non-integer numbers as well. For example, a
                        square root:

                      <p>
                        Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers. But, if the
                        binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates)
                        them:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the
                        other one is converted to a string too. For example:
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form that we
                        used above and the unary form. The unary plus or, in
                        other words, the plus operator + applied to a single
                        value, doesn’t do anything to numbers. But if the
                        operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into
                        a number.

                      <p>
                        Let’s note that an assignment = is also an operator. It
                        is listed in the precedence table with the very low
                        priority of 2. That’s why, when we assign a variable,
                        like x = 2 * 2 + 1, the calculations are done first and
                        then the = is evaluated, storing the result in x.
                      </p>

                      <h3>Assignment = returns a value</h3>
                      <p>
                        The fact of = being an operator, not a “magical”
                        language construct has an interesting implication. All
                        operators in JavaScript return a value. That’s obvious
                        for + and -, but also true for =. The call x = value
                        writes the value into x and then returns it.

                        assignments:

                      <p>
                        We often need to apply an operator to a variable and
                        store the new result in that same variable. For example:

                      <h2>Comma</h2>
                      <p>
                        The comma operator , is one of the rarest and most
                        unusual operators. Sometimes, it’s used to write shorter
                        code, so we need to know it in order to understand
                        what’s going on. The comma operator allows us to
                        evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma
                        ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the
                        last one is returned.

                        In Java, every application must contain a main() method,
                        which is the entry point for the application. All other
                        methods are invoked from the main() method. <br />
                        The signature of the method is public static void
                        main(String[] args) { }. It accepts a single argument:
                        an array of elements of type String.<br />

                      <p>
                        In Java, the boolean primitive data type is used to
                        store a value, which can be either true or false.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        A String in Java is a Object that holds multiple
                        characters. It is not a primitive datatype. A String can
                        be created by placing characters between a pair of
                        double quotes ("). To compare Strings, the equals()
                        method must be used instead of the primitive equality
                        comparator ==.

                        In Java, the int datatype is used to store integer
                        values. This means that it can store all positive and
                        negative whole numbers and zero.

                        The value of a variable cannot be changed if the
                        variable was declared using the final keyword. Note that
                        the variable must be given a value when it is declared
                        as final. final variables cannot be changed; any

                        % modulo (yields the remainder) <br />
                        These operations are not supported for other data types.

                      <p>
                        Comparison operators can be used to compare two values:
                        <br />
                        &gt; greater than <br />
                        &lt; less than <br />

                        == equal to <br />
                        != not equal to <br />
                        They are supported for primitive data types and the
                        result of a comparison is a boolean value true or false.

                        The increment operator, (++), can increase the value of
                        a number-based variable by 1 while the decrement
                        operator, (--), can decrease the value of a variable by
                        1.

                        will be exited. There can be multiple else-if statements
                        in a single conditional statement.

                      <p>
                        A nested conditional statement is a conditional
                        statement nested inside of another conditional
                        statement. The outer conditional statement is evaluated
                        first; if the condition is true, then the nested
                        conditional statement will be evaluated.
                      </p>

                        The AND logical operator is represented by &&. This
                        operator returns true if the boolean expressions on both
                        sides of the operator are true; otherwise, it returns
                        false.

                        The NOT logical operator is represented by !. This
                        operator negates the value of a boolean expression.

                        operator will return true if at least one of the boolean
                        expressions being compared has a true value; otherwise,
                        it will return false.

                      <p>
                        An index refers to an element’s position within an
                        array. The index of an array starts from 0 and goes up
                        to one less than the total length of the array.

                      <p>
                        In Java, an array is used to store a list of elements of
                        the same datatype. Arrays are fixed in size and their
                        elements are ordered.

                      <p>
                        In Java, an array can be created in the following ways:
                        <br />
                        Using the {} notation, by adding each element all at
                        once. <br />
                        Using the new keyword, and assigning each position of
                        the array individually. <br />
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        To change an element value, select the element via its
                        index and use the assignment operator to set a new
                        value.

                      <p>
                        In Java, an ArrayList is used to represent a dynamic
                        list. While Java arrays are fixed in size (the size
                        cannot be modified), an ArrayList allows flexibility by
                        being able to both add and remove elements.

                      <h2>For-each statement in Java</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Java, the for-each statement allows you to directly
                        loop through each item in an array or ArrayList and
                        perform some action with each item. <br />
                        When creating a for-each statement, you must include the
                        for keyword and two expressions inside of parentheses,
                        separated by a colon. These include: <br />
                        - The handle for an element we’re currently iterating
                        over. <br />
                        - The source array or ArrayList we’re iterating over.<br />

                        Python supports different types of arithmetic operations
                        that can be performed on literal numbers, variables, or
                        some combination. The primary arithmetic operators are:
                        <br />
                        + for addition <br />
                        - for subtraction <br />
                        * for multiplication <br />
                        / for division <br />
                        % for modulus (returns the remainder) <br />
                        ** for exponentiation <br />

                      <p>
                        The plus-equals operator += provides a convenient way to
                        add a value to an existing variable and assign the new
                        value back to the same variable. In the case where the
                        variable and the value are strings, this operator
                        performs string concatenation instead of addition. The
                        operation is performed in-place, meaning that any other
                        variable which points to the variable being updated will
                        also be updated.

                      <p>
                        A variable is used to store data that will be used by
                        the program. This data can be a number, a string, a
                        Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable
                        has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and
                        the underscore character _. The equal sign = is used to
                        assign a value to a variable. After the initial
                        assignment is made, the value of a variable can be
                        updated to new values as needed.

                        A modulo calculation returns the remainder of a division
                        between the first and second number. For example: <br />
                        - The result of the expression 4 % 2 would result in the
                        value 0, because 4 is evenly divisible by 2 leaving no
                        remainder.<br />
                        - The result of the expression 7 % 3 would return 1,
                        because 7 is not evenly divisible by 3, leaving a
                        remainder of 1.<br />

                        An integer is a number that can be written without a
                        fractional part (no decimal). An integer can be a
                        positive number, a negative number or the number 0 so
                        long as there is no decimal portion. The number 0
                        represents an integer value but the same number written
                        as 0.0 would represent a floating point number.

                      <p>
                        Python supports the joining (concatenation) of strings
                        together using the + operator. The + operator is also
                        used for mathematical addition operations. If the
                        parameters passed to the + operator are strings, then
                        concatenation will be performed. If the parameter passed
                        to + have different types, then Python will report an
                        error condition. Multiple variables or literal strings
                        can be joined together using the + operator.

                        A string is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers,
                        whitespace or punctuation) enclosed by quotation marks.
                        It can be enclosed using either the double quotation
                        mark " or the single quotation mark '. If a string has
                        to be broken into multiple lines, the backslash
                        character \ can be used to indicate that the string
                        continues on the next line.

                        number. A floating point number is a value that contains
                        a decimal portion. It can be used to represent numbers
                        that have fractional quantities. For example, a = 3/5
                        can not be represented as an integer, so the variable a
                        is assigned a floating point value of 0.6.

                        The print() function is used to output text, numbers, or
                        other printable information to the console. It takes one
                        or more arguments and will output each of the arguments
                        to the console separated by a space. If no arguments are
                        provided, the print() function will output a blank line.

                      <h2>elif Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        The Python elif statement allows for continued checks to
                        be performed after an initial if statement. An elif
                        statement differs from the else statement because
                        another expression is provided to be checked, just as
                        with the initial if statement. <br />

                        If the expression is True, the indented code following
                        the elif is executed. If the expression evaluates to
                        False, the code can continue to an optional else
                        statement. Multiple elif statements can be used
                        following an initial if to perform a series of checks.
                        Once an elif expression evaluates to True, no further
                        elif statements are executed.

                      <p>
                        The Python or operator combines two Boolean expressions
                        and evaluates to True if at least one of the expressions
                        returns True. Otherwise, if both expressions are False,
                        then the entire expression evaluates to False.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Equal Operator ==</h2>
                      <p>
                        The equal operator, ==, is used to compare two values,
                        variables or expressions to determine if they are the
                        same.<br />

                        If the values being compared are the same, the operator
                        returns True, otherwise it returns False.<br />

                        The operator takes the data type into account when
                        making the comparison, so a string value of "2" is not
                        considered the same as a numeric value of 2.

                      <p>
                        The Python not equals operator, !=, is used to compare
                        two values, variables or expressions to determine if
                        they are NOT the same. If they are NOT the same, the
                        operator returns True. If they are the same, then it
                        returns False.<br />

                        The operator takes the data type into account when
                        making the comparison so a value of 10 would NOT be
                        equal to the string value "10" and the operator would
                        return True. If expressions are used, then they are
                        evaluated to a value of True or False before the
                        comparison is made by the operator.

                      <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Python, relational operators compare two values or
                        expressions. The most common ones are: <br />

                        &lt; less than <br />
                        &gt; greater than <br />
                        &lt;= less than or equal to <br />
                        &gt; = greater than or equal too <br />
                        If the relation is sound, then the entire expression
                        will evaluate to True. If not, the expression evaluates
                        to False.

                      <p>
                        The Python if statement is used to determine the
                        execution of code based on the evaluation of a Boolean
                        expression. <br />

                        - If the if statement expression evaluates to True, then
                        the indented code following the statement is executed.
                        <br />
                        - If the expression evaluates to False then the indented
                        code following the if statement is skipped and the
                        program executes the next line of code which is indented
                        at the same level as the if statement.

                      <h2>else Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        The Python else statement provides alternate code to
                        execute if the expression in an if statement evaluates
                        to False. <br />

                        The indented code for the if statement is executed if
                        the expression evaluates to True. The indented code
                        immediately following the else is executed only if the
                        expression evaluates to False. To mark the end of the
                        else block, the code must be unindented to the same
                        level as the starting if line.

                      <h2>and Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The Python and operator performs a Boolean comparison
                        between two Boolean values, variables, or expressions.
                        If both sides of the operator evaluate to True then the
                        and operator returns True. If either side (or both
                        sides) evaluates to False, then the and operator returns
                        False. A non-Boolean value (or variable that stores a
                        value) will always evaluate to True when used with the
                        and operator.

                      <h2>Boolean Values</h2>
                      <p>
                        Booleans are a data type in Python, much like integers,
                        floats, and strings. However, booleans only have two
                        values: <br />

                        - True <br />
                        - False <br />
                        Specifically, these two values are of the bool type.
                        Since booleans are a data type, creating a variable that
                        holds a boolean value is the same as with other data
                        types.

                        The Python Boolean not operator is used in a Boolean
                        expression in order to evaluate the expression to its
                        inverse value. If the original expression was True,
                        including the not operator would make the expression
                        False, and vice versa.

                      <p>
                        In Python, lists are ordered collections of items that
                        allow for easy use of a set of data. List values are
                        placed in between square brackets [ ], separated by
                        commas. It is good practice to put a space between the
                        comma and the next value. The values in a list do not
                        need to be unique (the same value can be repeated).
                        Empty lists do not contain any values within the square
                        brackets.

                        result in a new list containing the same items in the

                        The Python list method .insert() allows us to add an
                        element to a specific index in a list. It takes in two
                        inputs: <br />

                        - The index that you want to insert into. <br />
                        - The element that you want to insert at the specified
                        index. <br />

                      <p>
                        In a loop, the break keyword escapes the loop,
                        regardless of the iteration number. Once break executes,
                        the program will continue to execute after the loop.

                      <p>
                        A Python for loop can be used to iterate over a list of
                        items and perform a set of actions on each item. The
                        syntax of a for loop consists of assigning a temporary
                        value to a variable on each successive iteration. <br />

                        When writing a for loop, remember to properly indent
                        each action, otherwise an IndentationError will result.

                        In Python, the continue keyword is used inside a loop to
                        skip the remaining code inside the loop code block and
                        begin the next loop iteration.

                      <p>
                        In Python, a for loop can be used to perform an action a
                        specific number of times in a row. <br />

                        The range() function can be used to create a list that
                        can be used to specify the number of iterations in a for
                        loop.

                      <p>
                        In Python, a while loop will repeatedly execute a code
                        block as long as a condition evaluates to True. <br />

                        The condition of a while loop is always checked first
                        before the block of code runs. If the condition is not
                        met initially, then the code block will never run.

                      <p>
                        In Python, loops can be nested inside other loops.
                        Nested loops can be used to access items of lists which
                        are inside other lists. The item selected from the outer
                        loop can be used as the list for the inner loop to
                        iterate over.

                      <h2>Function Parameters</h2>
                      <p>
                        Sometimes functions require input to provide data for
                        their code. This input is defined using parameters.
                        <br />

                        Parameters are variables that are defined in the
                        function definition. They are assigned the values which
                        were passed as arguments when the function was called,
                        elsewhere in the code. <br />

                        For example, the function definition defines parameters
                        for a character, a setting, and a skill, which are used
                        as inputs to write the first sentence of a book.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Multiple Parameters</h2>
                      <p>
                        Python functions can have multiple parameters. Just as
                        you wouldn’t go to school without both a backpack and a
                        pencil case, functions may also need more than one input
                        to carry out their operations. <br />

                        To define a function with multiple parameters, parameter
                        names are placed one after another, separated by commas,
                        within the parentheses of the function definition.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Functions</h2>
                      <p>
                        Some tasks need to be performed multiple times within a
                        program. Rather than rewrite the same code in multiple
                        places, a function may be defined using the def keyword.
                        Function definitions may include parameters, providing
                        data input to the function. <br />

                        Functions may return a value using the return keyword
                        followed by the value to return.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Function Indentation</h2>
                      <p>
                        Python uses indentation to identify blocks of code. Code
                        within the same block should be indented at the same
                        level. A Python function is one type of code block. All
                        code under a function declaration should be indented to
                        identify it as part of the function. There can be
                        additional indentation within a function to handle other
                        statements such as for and if so long as the lines are
                        not indented less than the first line of the function
                        code.

                      <p>
                        Python functions are able to return multiple values
                        using one return statement. All values that should be
                        returned are listed after the return keyword and are
                        separated by commas.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Returning Value from Function</h2>
                      <p>
                        A return keyword is used to return a value from a Python
                        function. The value returned from a function can be
                        assigned to a variable which can then be used in the
                        program. <br />

                        In the example, the function check_leap_year returns a
                        string which indicates if the passed parameter is a leap
                        year or not.

                        Comments are bits of text that are not executed. These
                        lines can be used to leave notes and increase the
                        readability of the program. <br />

                        - Single line comments are created with two forward

                      <h2>Variables and Types</h2>
                      <p>
                        A variable is a way to store data in the computer’s
                        memory to be used later in the program. C# is a
                        type-safe language, meaning that when variables are
                        declared it is necessary to define their data type.
                        <br />

                        Declaring the types of variables allows the compiler to

                      <p>
                        A boolean expression is any expression that evaluates
                        to, or returns, a boolean value.

                      <h2>Boolean Type</h2>
                      <p>
                        The bool data type can be either true or false and is
                        based on the concept that the validity of all logical
                        statements must be either true or false. <br />

                        Booleans encode the science of logic into computers,
                        allowing for logical reasoning in programs. In a broad
                        sense, the computer can encode the truthfulness or
                        falseness of certain statements, and based on that
                        information, completely alter the behavior of the
                        program.

                        The && operator takes two boolean expressions and
                        returns true only if they both evaluate to true. <br />

                        The || operator takes two boolean expressions and
                        returns true if either one evaluates to true. <br />

                        The ! operator takes one boolean expression and returns
                        the opposite value.

                      <h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
                      <p>
                        A comparison operator, as the name implies, compares two
                        expressions and returns either true or false depending
                        on the result of the comparison. For example, if we
                        compared two int values, we could test to see if one
                        number is greater than the other, or if both numbers are
                        equal. Similarly, we can test one string for equality
                        against another string.

                      <p>
                        In C#, an if statement executes a block of code based on
                        whether or not the boolean expression provided in the
                        parentheses is true or false. <br />

                        If the expression is true then the block of code inside
                        the braces, {}, is executed. Otherwise, the block is
                        skipped over.

                      <h2>Else Clause</h2>
                      <p>
                        An else followed by braces, {}, containing a code block,
                        is called an else clause. else clauses must always be
                        preceded by an if statement.<br />
                        The block inside the braces will only run if the
                        expression in the accompanying if condition is false. It
                        is useful for writing code that runs only if the code
                        inside the if statement is not executed.
                      </p>

                      <h2>If and Else If</h2>
                      <p>
                        A common pattern when writing multiple if and else
                        statements is to have an else block that contains
                        another nested if statement, which can contain another
                        else, etc. A better way to express this pattern in C# is
                        with else if statements. The first condition that
                        evaluates to true will run its associated code block. If
                        none are true, then the optional else block will run if
                        it exists.

                      <h2>Switch Statements</h2>
                      <p>
                        A switch statement is a control flow structure that
                        evaluates one expression and decides which code block to
                        run by trying to match the result of the expression to
                        each case. In general, a code block is executed when the
                        value given for a case equals the evaluated expression,
                        i.e, when == between the two values returns true. switch
                        statements are often used to replace if else structures
                        when all conditions test for equality on one value.

                      <p>
                        One of the uses of the break keyword in C# is to exit
                        out of switch/case blocks and resume program execution
                        after the switch code block. In C#, each case code block
                        inside a switch statement needs to be exited with the
                        break keyword (or some other jump statement), otherwise
                        the program will not compile. It should be called once
                        all of the instructions specific to that particular case
                        have been executed.

                        that parameter. If a method is called without passing in
                        an argument for the optional parameter, then the
                        parameter is initialized with its default value. <br />

                        To define an optional parameter, use an equals sign
                        after the parameter declaration followed by its default
                        value.

                      <p>
                        Parameters and variables declared inside of a method
                        cannot be used outside of the method’s body. Attempting
                        to do so will cause an error when compiling the program!

                      <p>
                        In C#, methods that do not return a value have a void
                        return type. <br />

                        void is not an actual data type like int or string, as
                        it represents the lack of an output or value.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Method Declaration</h2>
                      <p>
                        In C#, a method declaration, also known as a method
                        header, includes everything about the method other than
                        the method’s body. The method declaration includes:<br />

                        - the method name<br />
                        - parameter types<br />
                        - parameter order<br />
                        - parameter names<br />
                        - return type<br />
                        - optional modifiers<br />
                        A method declaration you’ve seen often is the
                        declaration for the Main method (note there is more than
                        one valid Main declaration):
                      </p>

                      />

                      <h2>Lambda Expressions</h2>
                      <p>
                        A lambda expression is a block of code that is treated
                        like any other value or expression. It can be passed
                        into methods, stored in variables, and created inside
                        methods.<br />

                        In particular, lambda expressions are useful for
                        creating anonymous methods, methods with no name, to be
                        passed into methods that require method arguments. Their
                        concise syntax is more elegant than declaring a regular
                        method when they are being used as one off method
                        arguments.

                      <h1>Arrays and Loops</h1>

                      <h2>C# Arrays</h2>
                      <p>
                        In C#, an array is a structure representing a fixed
                        length ordered collection of values or objects with the
                        same type.<br />

                        Arrays make it easier to organize and operate on large
                        amounts of data. For example, rather than creating 100
                        integer variables, you can just create one array that
                        stores all those integers!
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/csharparray.jpg"
                        alt="C# Arrays"
                      />

                      <h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>
                      <p>
                        A C# array variable is declared similarly to a non-array
                        variable, with the addition of square brackets ([])
                        after the type specifier to denote it as an array.<br />

                        The new keyword is needed when instantiating a new array
                        to assign to the variable, as well as the array length
                        in the square brackets. The array can also be
                        instantiated with values using curly braces ({}). In
                        this case the array length is not necessary.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Declare and Initialize array</h2>
                      <p>
                        The following math operations are supported: <br />
                        Addition +, <br />
                        Subtraction -, <br />
                        Multiplication *, <br />
                        Division /, <br />
                        Remainder%, <br />
                        Exponentiation **. <br />
                      </p>
                      <h3>Remainder %</h3>
                      <p>
                        The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not
                        related to percents. The result of a % b is the
                        remainder of the integer division of a by b.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Array Element Access</h2>
                      <p>
                        In C#, the elements of an array are labeled
                        incrementally, starting at 0 for the first element. For
                        example, the 3rd element of an array would be indexed at
                        2, and the 6th element of an array would be indexed at
                        5. <br />

                        A specific element can be accessed by using the square
                        bracket operator, surrounding the index with square
                        brackets. Once accessed, the element can be used in an
                        expression, or modified like a regular variable.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The Length property of a C# array can be used to get the
                        number of elements in a particular array.

                      <h2>C# For Loops</h2>
                      <p>
                        A C# for loop executes a set of instructions for a
                        specified number of times, based on three provided
                        expressions. The three expressions are separated by
                        semicolons, and in order they are: Initialization,
                        Stopping condition, Iteration statement.
                      </p>

                        "
                      />

                      <h2>C# For Each Loop</h2>
                      <p>
                        A C# foreach loop runs a set of instructions once for
                        each element in a given collection. For example, if an
                        array has 200 elements, then the foreach loop’s body
                        will execute 200 times. At the start of each iteration,
                        a variable is initialized to the current element being
                        processed.<br />

                        A for each loop is declared with the foreach keyword.
                        Next, in parentheses, a variable type and variable name
                        followed by the in keyword and the collection to iterate
                        over.
                      </p>

                      <h2>C# While Loop</h2>
                      <p>
                        In C#, a while loop executes a set of instructions
                        continuously while the given boolean expression
                        evaluates to true or one of the instructions inside the
                        loop body, such as the break instruction, terminates the
                        loop.<br />

                        Note that the loop body might not run at all, since the
                        boolean condition is evaluated before the very first
                        iteration of the while loop.<br />

                        The syntax to declare a while loop is simply the while
                        keyword followed by a boolean condition in parentheses.
                      </p>
                      <img
                        src="./assests/img/csharpwhile.jpg"

                        "
                      />

                      <h2>C# Do While Loop</h2>
                      <p>
                        In C#, a do while loop runs a set of instructions once
                        and then continues running as long as the given boolean
                        condition is true. Notice how this behavior is nearly
                        identical to a while loop, with the distinction that a
                        do while runs one or more times, and a while loop runs
                        zero or more times.<br />

                        The syntax to declare a do while is the do keyword,
                        followed by the code block, then the while keyword with
                        the boolean condition in parentheses. Note that a
                        semi-colon is necessary to end a do while loop.
                      </p>

                      <h2>C# Jump Statements</h2>
                      <p>
                        Jump statements are tools used to give the programmer
                        additional control over the program’s control flow. They
                        are very commonly used in the context of loops to exit
                        from the loop or to skip parts of the loop.<br />

                        Control flow keywords include break, continue, and
                        return. The given code snippets provide examples of
                        their usage.

                      <p>
                        In C++, a vector is a dynamic list of items, that can
                        shrink and grow in size. It is created using
                        std::vector&lt;type&gt; name; and it can only store
                        values of the same type. <br />
                        To use vectors, it is necessary to #include the vector
                        library.

                        The following functions can be used to add and remove an
                        element in a vector:<br />

                        - .push_back() to add an element to the “end” of a
                        vector<br />
                        - .pop_back() to remove an element from the “end” of a

                      <p>
                        The rules that dictate the correct format of code for a
                        specific programming language are known as syntax.<br />

                        Examples of syntax in C are:<br />

                        - All statements must end with a semicolon, ;<br />
                        - Keywords and other code elements are case-sensitive<br />
                        When compiling C code, an error will occur when the
                        syntax of the code is incorrect.

                      <p>
                        In C, an escape sequence is a non-visual character used
                        within a string.<br />

                        \n is an escape sequence that adds a newline to a
                        string. \t is an escape sequence that adds a tab of
                        spaces to a string.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In C, comments are text within code that will be ignored
                        by the compiler. They are used to document code.<br />

                        Line comments begin with a double forward slash, //. All
                        text after // will be part of the comment until a new
                        line is reached.<br />

                        Block comments begin with a forward slash and asterisk,
                        /* and end with an asterisk and forward slash, */. Block
                        comments can span multiple lines as new lines are part
                        of the comment.

                      <p>
                        gcc is an application used to compile C programs into an
                        executable that can run on the target computer. gcc
                        stands for GNU Compiler Collection.<br />

                        gcc compiles C code using the code file as an unflagged
                        command-line argument. The output executable file will
                        be called a.out. The -o flag followed by some text can
                        be used to designate the name of the output executable
                        file.

                      <p>
                        In C variable names must follow specific rules:<br />

                        - Names can only be composed of upper and lower case
                        letters, numbers, and underscores.<br /><br />
                        - The first character must be a letter (upper or lower
                        case). - No keywords are allowed as the full name (int
                        is not allowed but int_count would work).
                      </p>

                        Variables in C can be initialized with values at their
                        declaration or have their values set later in the code.

                        from one data type to another. They can then be used
                        directly or stored in another variable.

                        C is able to perform basic mathematical operations on
                        variables and values using the following symbols:<br />

                        - Addition: + <br />
                        - Subtraction: - <br />

                        - Assignment: = <br />
                        - Addition then assignment: += <br />
                        - Subtraction then assignment: -= <br />
                        - Multiplication then assignment: *= <br />
                        - Division then assignment: /= <br />

                        follows:<br />

                        - Do both sides have the same value? == <br />
                        - Do the two sides have different values? != <br />
                        - Is the left side a lower value than the right side?
                        &lt; <br />
                        - Is the left side a lower or equal value to the right
                        side? &lt;;= v - Is the left side a greater value than
                        the right side? &gt; <br />
                        - Is the left side a greater or equal value to the right

                      <h2>Applications of PHP</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP is a server scripting language used for making
                        dynamic web pages. That means PHP allows you to use
                        scripts on a web server to produce a response customized
                        for each client’s (user’s) request.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Terminating a PHP Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        In PHP, a semicolon ; must be used to terminate a
                        statement.
                      </p>

                      <h2>PHP Keyword Case-Insensitivity</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP is NOT case sensitive for language keywords like if,
                        else, null, echo, foreach, etc.<br />

                        On the other hand, constants, variables, array keys,
                        class constants and class properties are case sensitive.
                      </p>

                      <h2>PHP Comments</h2>
                      <p>
                        Comments are text within code that won’t be executed
                        when the program is run.<br />

                        For single line comments, the syntax is // or #.
                        Anything after these symbols on a line is ignored by the
                        PHP interpreter.<br />

                        For multi-line comments, anything between /* and */ is
                        ignored by the interpreter.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Embedding PHP Code</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP can generate HTML when saved as a file with a .php
                        extension. These files must always start with the tag
                        &lt;?php (closing tag is optional).<br />

                        PHP can also be embedded into HTML. In this case, both
                        opening tag &lt;?php and closing tag ?&gt; are used .<br />
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The echo keyword in PHP is used to write output to the
                        browser, if being served.<br />

                        If it is executed in the command-line, then the echo
                        keyword writes the output to the terminal.<br />
                      </p>

                      <h1>Variables</h1>

                      <h2>Parsing Variables within PHP Strings</h2>
                      <p>
                        In PHP, variables can be parsed within strings specified
                        with double quotes (").<br />

                        This means that within the string, the computer will
                        replace an occurence of a variable with that variable’s
                        value.<br />

                        When additional valid identifier characters (ie.
                        characters that could be included in a variable name)
                        are intended to appear adjacent to the variable’s value,
                        the variable name can be wrapped in curly braces {},
                        thus avoiding confusion as to the variable’s name.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Reassignment of PHP Variables</h2>
                      <p>
                        In PHP, variables are assigned values with the
                        assignment operator (=). The same variable can later be
                        reassigned a new value using the same operator. This
                        process is known as reassignment.

                      <p>
                        In PHP, there is a shortcut for appending a new string
                        to the end of another string. This can be easily done
                        with the string concatenation assignment operator (.=).

                      <h2>PHP Strings</h2>
                      <p>
                        In PHP, a string is a sequence of characters surrounded
                        by double quotation marks. It can be as long as you want
                        and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.
                      </p>

                      <h2>PHP Variables</h2>
                      <p>
                        In PHP, variables are assigned values with the
                        assignment operator (=).<br />

                        Variable names can contain numbers, letters, and
                        underscores (_). A sigil ($) must always precede a
                        variable name. They cannot start with a number and they
                        cannot have spaces or any special characters.<br />

                        The convention in PHP is to use snake case for variable
                        naming; this means that lowercase words are delimited
                        with an underscore character (_). Variable names are
                        case-sensitive.<br />

                      <h2>Arithmetic Operators in PHP</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP supports arithmetic operators for addition (+),
                        subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
                      </p>

                      <h2>The Modulo Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP supports a modulo operator (%). The modulo operator
                        returns the remainder of the left operand divided by the
                        right operand. Operands of a modulo operation are
                        converted to integers prior to performing the operation.
                        The operation returns an integer with the same sign as
                        the dividend.

                        A variable with local scope can only be accessed within
                        the function it is declared. A variable with global
                        scope can be accessed from multiple functions in the PHP
                        script.

                        The return statement is used to return the final output
                        of a function. Once the first return statement is
                        executed, the function is exited.

                        executed. It is defined by using the keyword function
                        followed by the name of the function, the parentheses
                        which contain the parameters, and finally the curly
                        braces which contain the code block.

                        When writing a function in PHP, the convention is to use
                        camel case. This means that we start with a lowercase
                        letter and then capitalize the first letter of every new
                        word.<br />

                        Additionally, the function name should typically start
                        with a verb.

                      <h2>PHP If Statements</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP if statements evaluate a boolean value or expression
                        and execute the provided code block if the expression
                        evaluates to TRUE.
                      </p>

                      <h2>PHP switch statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        PHP switch statements provide a clear syntax for a
                        series of comparisons in which a value or expression is
                        compared to many possible matches and code blocks are
                        executed based on the matching case.<br />

                        In PHP, once a matched case is encountered, the code
                        blocks of all subsequent cases (regardless of match)
                        will be executed until a return, break, or the end of
                        the statement is reached. This is known as fall through.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        PHP elseif statements must be paired with an if
                        statement, but many elseifs can be chained from a single
                        if.<br />

                        elseifs provide an additional condition to check (and
                        corresponding code to execute) if the conditional
                        statements of the if block and any preceding elseifs are
                        not met.

                      <p>
                        PHP Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE, which are
                        the only members of the boolean type
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In PHP, nested conditional statements deepen the
                        complexity of our programs’ decision-making
                        capabilities. They allow us to create programs where
                        each decision made sends our program on a different
                        route where it might encounter additional decisions.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In PHP, expressions that use logical operators evaluate
                        to boolean values. Logical operators include:<br />

                        - or (||)<br />
                        - and (&&)<br />
                        - exclusive or (xor)<br />

                      <p>
                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content
                        to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to
                        structure that content.
                      </p>

                      <h2>HTML Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML
                        document and uses the following syntax: opening tag +
                        content + closing tag. In the code provided:<br />

                        - &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag.<br />
                        - Hello World! is the content.<br />
                        - &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag.

                      <p>
                        The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle
                        bracket &lt; followed by the element name and a closing
                        angle bracket &gt;. Here is an example of an opening

                        The &lt;video&gt; element embeds a media player for
                        video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL
                        to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display
                        video controls in the media player.

                      <p>
                        The &lt;div&gt; element is used as a container that
                        divides an HTML document into sections and is short for
                        “division”. &lt;div&gt; elements can contain flow
                        content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images,
                        etc.

                        An HTML closing tag is used to denote the end of an HTML
                        element. The syntax for a closing tag is a left angle
                        bracket &lt; followed by a forward slash / then the
                        element name and a right angle bracket to close &gt;.

                      <p>
                        The &lt;br&gt; line break element will create a line
                        break in text and is especially useful where a division
                        of text is required, like in a postal address. The line
                        break element requires only an opening tag and must not
                        have a closing tag.

                        HTML image &lt;img&gt; elements embed images in
                        documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and
                        is mandatory. &lt;img&gt; is an empty element meaning it
                        should not have a closing tag.

                        HTML can use six different levels of heading elements.
                        The heading elements are ordered from the highest level
                        &lt;h1&gt; to the lowest level &lt;h6&gt;.

                      <p>
                        HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of
                        an element to configure the element or change the
                        element’s default behavior. In the provided example, we
                        are giving the &lt;p&gt; (paragraph) element a unique
                        identifier using the id attribute and changing the color
                        of the default text using the style attribute

                        The &lt;body&gt; element represents the content of an
                        HTML document. Content inside &lt;body&gt; tags are
                        rendered on the web browsers.

                      <p>
                        The &lt;span&gt; element is an inline container for text
                        and can be used to group text for styling purposes.
                        However, as &lt;span&gt; is a generic container to
                        separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its
                        use should be avoided if a more semantic element is
                        available.

                      <h2>&lt;a&gt; Anchor Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;a&gt; anchor element is used to create
                        hyperlinks in an HTML document. The hyperlinks can point
                        to other webpages, files on the same server, a location
                        on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink
                        reference attribute, href. The href determines the
                        location the anchor element points to.

                      <h2>&lt;head&gt; Head Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;head&gt; element contains general information
                        about an HTML page that isn’t displayed on the page
                        itself. This information is called metadata and includes
                        things like the title of the HTML document and links to
                        stylesheets.
                      </p>

                      <h2>&lt;target&gt; Target Attribute</h2>
                      <p>
                        The target attribute on an &lt;a&gt; anchor element
                        specifies where a hyperlink should be opened. A target
                        value of "_blank" will tell the browser to open the
                        hyperlink in a new tab in modern browsers, or in a new
                        window in older browsers or if the browser has had
                        settings changed to open hyperlinks in a new window.

                      <h2>&lt;html&gt; HTML Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;html&gt; element, the root of an HTML document,
                        should be added after the !DOCTYPE declaration. All
                        content/structure for an HTML document should be
                        contained between the opening and closing &lt;html&gt;
                        tags.

                      <h2>&lt;title&gt; Title Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;title&gt; element contains a text that defines
                        the title of an HTML document. The title is displayed in
                        the browser’s title bar or tab in which the HTML page is
                        displayed. The &lt;title&gt; element can only be
                        contained inside a document’s &lt;head&gt; element.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Indentation</h2>
                      <p>
                        HTML code should be formatted such that the indentation
                        level of text increases once for each level of
                        nesting.<br />

                        It is a common convention to use two or four space per
                        level of nesting.

                      <h2>Link to a Different Part of the Page #</h2>
                      <p>
                        The anchor element &lt;a&gt; can create hyperlinks to
                        different parts of the same HTML document using the href
                        attribute to point to the desired location with #
                        followed by the id of the element to link to.

                      <h2>Comments</h2>
                      <p>
                        In HTML, comments can be added between an opening
                        &lt;!-- and closing --&gt;. Content inside of comments
                        will not be rendered by browsers, and are usually used
                        to describe a part of code or provide other details.<br />

                        Comments can span single or multiple lines.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Whitespace</h2>
                      <p>
                        Whitespace, such as line breaks, added to an HTML
                        document between block-level elements will generally be
                        ignored by the browser and are not added to increase
                        spacing on the rendered HTML page. Rather, whitespace is
                        added for organization and easier reading of the HTML
                        document itself.
                      </p>

                      />

                      <h2>File Path</h2>
                      <p>
                        URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full
                        URL, for example:
                        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn or a
                        relative file path that links to a local file in the
                        same folder or on the same server, for example:
                        ./style.css. Relative file paths begin with ./ followed
                        by a path to the local file. ./ tells the browser to
                        look for the file path from the current folder.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Document Type Declaration</h2>
                      <p>
                        The document type declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is
                        required as the first line of an HTML document. The
                        doctype declaration is an instruction to the browser
                        about what type of document to expect and which version
                        of HTML is being used, in this case it’s HTML5.

                      <p>
                        In HTML, the &lt;table&gt; element has content that is
                        used to represent a two-dimensional table made of rows
                        and columns.

                      <p>
                        The table row element, &lt;tr&gt;, is used to add rows
                        to a table before adding table data and table headings.

                      <p>
                        The table data element, &lt;td&gt;, can be nested inside
                        a table row element, &lt;tr&gt;, to add a cell of data
                        to a table.

                      <h2>&lt;thead&gt; Table Head Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The table head element, &lt;thead&gt;, defines the
                        headings of table columns encapsulated in table rows.

                      <p>
                        The table body element, &lt;tbody&gt;, is a semantic
                        element that will contain all table data other than
                        table heading and table footer content. If used,
                        &lt;tbody&gt; will contain all table row &lt;tr&gt;
                        elements, and indicates that &lt;tr&gt; elements make up
                        the body of the table. &lt;table&gt; cannot have both
                        &lt;tbody&gt; and &lt;tr&gt; as direct children.

                      <p>
                        The table heading element, &lt;th&gt;, is used to add
                        titles to rows and columns of a table and must be
                        enclosed in a table row element, &lt;tr&gt;.

                      <h2>&lt;tfoot&gt; Table Footer Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The table footer element, &lt;tfoot&gt;, uses table rows
                        to give footer content or to summarize content at the
                        end of a table.

                      <h2>colspan Attribute</h2>
                      <p>
                        The colspan attribute on a table header &lt;th&gt; or
                        table data &lt;td&gt; element indicates how many columns
                        that particular cell should span within the table. The
                        colspan value is set to 1 by default and will take any
                        positive integer between 1 and 1000.

                        Similar to colspan, the rowspan attribute on a table
                        header or table data element indicates how many rows
                        that particular cell should span within the table. The
                        rowspan value is set to 1 by default and will take any

                      <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
                      <p>
                        Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the code we write.
                        Before Semantic HTML the elements didn’t have any
                        meaning as to what it does or what content goes in it.
                        An element such as &lt;div&gt; was used as a
                        general-purpose element to create things from headers to
                        footers to articles. With Semantic HTML we were
                        introduced to elements that tell developers and browsers
                        exactly what it does and what content should go in it.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Element Placement</h2>
                      <p>
                        Semantic HTML introduces elements that can tell
                        developers exactly what the element does or where it’s
                        placed based on the name of that element. Some of these
                        elements are &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;,
                        and &lt;footer&gt;. &lt;header&gt; describes the content
                        at the top of the page &lt;body&gt;. It may include a
                        logo, navigational links or a search bar. &lt;nav&gt;
                        encapsulates the page’s navigational links. It is often
                        placed inside the &lt;header&gt; or &lt;footer&gt;.
                        &lt;main&gt; encapsulates the main content of a page
                        between the header/navigation and the footer areas.
                        &lt;footer&gt; includes the page’s footer content at the
                        bottom of the &lt;body&gt;.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Semantic HTML introduces us to &lt;video&gt;,
                        &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;embed&gt;. &lt;video&gt; allows us
                        to add videos to our website. &lt;audio&gt; allows us to
                        implement audio into our website. &lt;embed&gt; can be
                        used to implement any type of media. These elements are
                        universal in that they all use the src attribute to link
                        the source of the content. &lt;video&gt; and
                        &lt;audio&gt; requires a closing tag while &lt;embed&gt;
                        is a self-closing tag.

                      <h2>&lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt;</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;figure&gt; element is used to encapsulate media
                        such as an image, diagram. or code snippet. The
                        &lt;figcaption&gt; element is used to describe the media
                        encapsulated within the &lt;figure&gt; element.
                        Developers will normally use &lt;figcaption&gt; within
                        the &lt;figure&gt; element to group the media and
                        description. This way, if a developer decides to change
                        the position of the media, the description will follow
                        along with it.

                      <h2>&lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt;</h2>
                      <p>
                        &lt;section&gt; defines elements in a document, such as
                        chapters, headings, or any other area of the document
                        with the same theme. &lt;article&gt; holds content that
                        makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, and
                        comments. Generally developers will use &lt;section&gt;
                        to define a theme for the webpage and use
                        &lt;article&gt; to write independent content for that
                        theme. This does not mean that &lt;article&gt; has to be
                        used with &lt;section&gt;.
                      </p>

                      <h2>&lt;aside&gt; Aside Element</h2>
                      <p>
                        The &lt;aside&gt; element is used to mark additional
                        information that can enhance another element but isn’t
                        required in order to understand the main content.
                        Usually, this information would be in a sidebar or a
                        location where it doesn’t obstruct the main piece of
                        content. An example of this would be an article that
                        discusses how to take care of a dog and next to the
                        article an ad would appear advertising a dog grooming
                        product.

                      <p>
                        Column constraints are the rules applied to the values
                        of individual columns:<br />

                        - PRIMARY KEY constraint can be used to uniquely
                        identify the row.<br />
                        - UNIQUE columns have a different value for every
                        row.<br />
                        - NOT NULL columns must have a value.<br />
                        - DEFAULT assigns a default value for the column when no
                        value is specified.<br />
                        There can be only one PRIMARY KEY column per table and
                        multiple UNIQUE columns.

                      <h2>CREATE TABLE Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        The CREATE TABLE statement creates a new table in a
                        database. It allows one to specify the name of the table
                        and the name of each column in the table.

                      <p>
                        The INSERT INTO statement is used to add a new record
                        (row) to a table. It has two forms as shown:<br />

                        - Insert into columns in order.<br />
                        - Insert into columns by name.

                      <h2>ALTER TABLE Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        The ALTER TABLE statement is used to modify the columns
                        of an existing table. When combined with the ADD COLUMN
                        clause, it is used to add a new column.

                      <p>
                        The DELETE statement is used to delete records (rows) in
                        a table. The WHERE clause specifies which record or
                        records that should be deleted. If the WHERE clause is
                        omitted, all records will be deleted.

                      <p>
                        The UPDATE statement is used to edit records (rows) in a
                        table. It includes a SET clause that indicates the
                        column to edit and a WHERE clause for specifying the
                        record(s).

                      <h2>AND Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The AND operator allows multiple conditions to be
                        combined. Records must match both conditions that are
                        joined by AND to be included in the result set. The
                        given query will match any car that is blue and made
                        after 2014.

                      <p>
                        Columns or tables can be aliased using the AS clause.
                        This allows columns or tables to be specifically renamed
                        in the returned result set. The given query will return
                        a result set with the column for name renamed to
                        movie_title.

                      <p>
                        The OR operator allows multiple conditions to be
                        combined. Records matching either condition joined by
                        the OR are included in the result set. The given query
                        will match customers whose state is either 'CA' or 'NY'.

                      <p>
                        The % wildcard can be used in a LIKE operator pattern to
                        match zero or more unspecified character(s). The given
                        query will match any movie that begins with The,

                        The SELECT * statement returns all columns from the
                        provided table in the result set. The given query will
                        fetch all columns and records (rows) from the movies
                        table.

                      <p>
                        The _ wildcard can be used in a LIKE operator pattern to
                        match any single unspecified character. The given query
                        will match any movie which begins with a single

                      <p>
                        The ORDER BY clause can be used to sort the result set
                        by a particular column either alphabetically or
                        numerically. It can be ordered in two ways:<br />

                        - DESC is a keyword used to sort the results in
                        descending order. <br />
                        - ASC is a keyword used to sort the results in ascending
                        order (default).

                      />

                      <h2>LIKE Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The LIKE operator can be used inside of a WHERE clause
                        to match a specified pattern. The given query will match
                        any movie that begins with Star in its title.

                      <p>
                        Unique values of a column can be selected using a

                      <h2>BETWEEN Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The BETWEEN operator can be used to filter by a range of
                        values. The range of values can be text, numbers, or
                        date data. The given query will match any movie made
                        between the years 1980 and 1990, inclusive.

                        The LIMIT clause is used to narrow, or limit, a result
                        set to the specified number of rows. The given query
                        will limit the result set to 5 rows.

                        Column values can be NULL, or have no value. These
                        records can be matched (or not matched) using the IS
                        NULL and IS NOT NULL operators in combination with the
                        WHERE clause. The given query will match all addresses
                        where the address has a value or is not NULL.

                      <p>
                        The WHERE clause is used to filter records (rows) that
                        match a certain condition. The given query will select
                        all records where the pub_year equals 2017.

                      <p>
                        The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses can reference the
                        selected columns by number in which they appear in the
                        SELECT statement. The example query will count the

                        The SUM() aggregate function takes the name of a column
                        as an argument and returns the sum of all the value in
                        that column.

                      <p>
                        The MAX() aggregate function takes the name of a column
                        as an argument and returns the largest value in a
                        column. The given query will return the largest value
                        from the amount column.

                      <p>
                        The COUNT() aggregate function returns the total number
                        of rows that match the specified criteria. For instance,
                        to find the total number of employees who have less than
                        5 years of experience, the given query can be used.

                      <h2>GROUP BY Clause</h2>
                      <p>
                        The GROUP BY clause will group records in a result set
                        by identical values in one or more columns. It is often
                        used in combination with aggregate functions to query
                        information of similar records. The GROUP BY clause can
                        come after FROM or WHERE but must come before any ORDER
                        BY or LIMIT clause.

                      <h2>MIN() Aggregate Function</h2>
                      <p>
                        The MIN() aggregate function returns the smallest value
                        in a column. For instance, to find the smallest value of
                        the amount column from the table named transactions, the
                        given query can be used.

                      <h2>AVG() Aggregate Function</h2>
                      <p>
                        The AVG() aggregate function returns the average value
                        in a column. For instance, to find the average salary
                        for the employees who have less than 5 years of
                        experience, the given query can be used.

                      <h2>HAVING Clause</h2>
                      <p>
                        The HAVING clause is used to further filter the result
                        set groups provided by the GROUP BY clause. HAVING is
                        often used with aggregate functions to filter the result
                        set groups based on an aggregate property. The given
                        query will select only the records (rows) from only
                        years where more than 5 movies were released per
                        year.<br />

                        The HAVING clause must always come after a GROUP BY
                        clause but must come before any ORDER BY or LIMIT
                        clause.

                      <p>
                        The ROUND() function will round a number value to a
                        specified number of places. It takes two arguments: a
                        number, and a number of decimal places. It can be
                        combined with other aggregate functions, as shown in the
                        given query. This query will calculate the average
                        rating of movies from 2015, rounding to 2 decimal
                        places.

                      <p>
                        An outer join will combine rows from different tables
                        even if the join condition is not met. In a LEFT JOIN,
                        every row in the left table is returned in the result
                        set, and if the join condition is not met, then NULL
                        values are used to fill in the columns from the right
                        table.

                      <p>
                        The JOIN clause allows for the return of results from
                        more than one table by joining them together with other
                        results based on common column values specified using an
                        ON clause. INNER JOIN is the default JOIN and it will
                        only return results matching the condition specified by
                        ON.

                      <h2>WITH Clause</h2>
                      <p>
                        The WITH clause stores the result of a query in a
                        temporary table (temporary_movies) using an alias.<br />

                        Multiple temporary tables can be defined with one
                        instance of the WITH keyword.

                      <p>
                        The UNION clause is used to combine results that appear
                        from multiple SELECT statements and filter
                        duplicates.<br />

                        For example, given a first_names table with a column
                        name containing rows of data “James” and “Hermione”, and
                        a last_names table with a column name containing rows of
                        data “James”, “Hermione” and “Cassidy”, the result of
                        this query would contain three names: “Cassidy”,
                        “James”, and “Hermione”.

                      <h2>CROSS JOIN Clause</h2>
                      <p>
                        The CROSS JOIN clause is used to combine each row from
                        one table with each row from another in the result set.
                        This JOIN is helpful for creating all possible
                        combinations for the records (rows) in two tables.<br />

                        The given query will select the shirt_color and
                        pants_color columns from the result set, which will
                        contain all combinations of combining the rows in the
                        shirts and pants tables. If there are 3 different shirt
                        colors in the shirts table and 5 different pants colors
                        in the pants table then the result set will contain 3 x
                        5 = 15 rows.

                      <h2>Foreign Key</h2>
                      <p>
                        A foreign key is a reference in one table’s records to
                        the primary key of another table. To maintain multiple
                        records for a specific row, the use of foreign key plays
                        a vital role. For instance, to track all the orders of a
                        specific customer, the table order (illustrated at the
                        bottom of the image) can contain a foreign key.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Primary Key</h2>
                      <p>
                        A primary key column in a SQL table is used to uniquely
                        identify each record in that table. A primary key cannot
                        be NULL. In the example, customer_id is the primary key.
                        The same value cannot re-occur in a primary key column.
                        Primary keys are often used in JOIN operations.

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, a variable is a place to store values of almost
                        any type including Integer, Boolean, String, Array, and
                        Hashes.<br />

                        Each variable has its own name which cannot begin with a
                        capital letter or a number and we use the equal sign for
                        assigning a value to that variable.<br />

                        The variable declaration does not require that you
                        mention a specific data type.<br />

                        Commenting code helps programmers write free text that
                        is commonly used to explain the code written, or can
                        even be used to add TODO’s to the code. There are two
                        types of comments that can be written in Ruby:<br />

                        - <strong>Single line comments</strong> start with a #.
                        <br />
                        - <strong>Multi line comments</strong> start with =begin
                        and end with =end.

                        In Ruby, the Numeric data type represents numbers
                        including integers and floats.

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, we can use arithmetic operators to evaluate
                        mathematical expressions. The most common Ruby
                        arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-),
                        division(/), multiplication(*), exponentiation(**) and
                        modulo(%).

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, methods are built-in abilities of objects. To
                        access an object’s methods, you need to call it using a
                        . and the method name.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Strings in Ruby are a sequence of characters enclosed by
                        single quotation marks (‘’) or double quotation marks
                        (“”).

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, in order to represent values of truth about
                        specific statements, we use Boolean variables. Boolean
                        variables values are either true or false.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby .upcase and .downcase Methods</h2>
                      <p>
                        Ruby strings have an .upcase and a .downcase method used
                        to change their case. .upcase returns a version of the
                        string in all uppercase, and .downcase returns a version
                        in all lowercase.

                        In Ruby, string interpolation is used to insert the
                        result of Ruby code into a string.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, we can get the user’s input using gets.chomp.
                        gets is the method that is used to retrieve user input.
                        Ruby automatically adds a new line after each bit of
                        input, so chomp is used to remove that extra line.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, an elsif statement can be placed between if and
                        else statements. It allows us to check for additional
                        conditions.<br />

                        More than one elsif can be placed between if and else.

                      <h2>not Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The ! (not) operator in Ruby flips a boolean value. If a
                        value is true then applying ! to the value changes it to
                        false and vice versa.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Else statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, an if statement evaluates to either true or
                        false. The code indented after the if portion is
                        executed for true while the code indented after the else
                        portion is executed for false.

                        The following comparison or relational operators are
                        used in Ruby to compare values. &gt; - greater than;
                        &lt; - less than; &gt;= - greater than or equal to; &lt=
                        - less than or equal to; == - equal to

                      <h2>Or operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        The || (or) operator is a logical operator which returns
                        true if either of the expressions on left-hand side or
                        right-hand side is true.

                      <h2>if Statement</h2>
                      <p>
                        TAn if statement in Ruby evaluates an expression, which
                        returns either true or false. If the expression is true,
                        Ruby executes the code block that follows the if whereas
                        if the expression is false, Ruby returns nil.<br />

                        In this example, the string "Your condition was true!"
                        will print because the condition number == 10 is true.

                      <p>
                        && is a logical operator in Ruby which evaluates to true
                        only if both expressions on either side of && evaluates
                        to true.

                      <p>
                        An unless statement in Ruby is used to evaluate an
                        expression. If the expression evaluates to false, then
                        the code following unless is executed.

                        Assignment operators in Ruby are used to assign or
                        update values to variables. The most common assignment
                        operator is = but others also exist, like +=, -=, *= and
                        /=.

                      <p>
                        To iterate over an array in Ruby, use the .each method.
                        It is preferred over a for loop as it is guaranteed to
                        iterate through each element of an array.

                      <p>
                        In Ruby, the next keyword is used within a loop to pass
                        over certain elements and skip to the following
                        iteration. It is useful for omitting elements that you
                        do not wish to have iterated. next is followed by an if
                        statement which defines which elements are to be
                        skipped.

                      <p>
                        Putting a block of code in a while loop in Ruby will

                        If the block of code doesn’t have a way for the
                        condition to be changed to false, the while loop will
                        continue forever and cause an error.

                        In ruby, a sequence of integers can be demonstrated by a
                        range. The range can be divided into an inclusive range
                        where the last integer in the sequence is included and
                        an exclusive range where the last integer is excluded.

                      <p>
                        A loop method can be used to run a block of code
                        repeatedly in Ruby. Either use curly braces ({}) or the
                        do/end keyword combination to wrap the block the code

                        Putting a block of code inside an until loop in Ruby
                        will cause the code to run as long as its condition
                        remains false. It’s only when the condition becomes true

                        A hash is denoted by a set of curly braces ({}) which
                        contains key-value pairs separated by commas. Each value
                        is assigned to a key using a hash rocket (=>). Calling
                        the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs
                        the value associated with that key.

                      <h2>Ruby Array</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, an array is an ordered collection of Ruby
                        objects separated by commas and enclosed in []. An array
                        can contain the same or different types of Ruby objects,
                        such as Integers, Strings, Floats, etc. An array can
                        also be empty.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, arrays can be nested within one another
                        representing multi dimensional arrays. An array can hold
                        another array as if it was like any other Ruby object,
                        such as an Integer or a String.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Array Index</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, each item inside of an array is at a numbered
                        position called an index. The first item is at index 0,
                        the second item is at index 1, and so on. We can access
                        the ith element of an array by putting the index in
                        square brackets after invoking the array’s name; this is
                        known as access by index
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Method .Each</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, the .each method is used to iterate over arrays
                        and hashes. This allows each element in an array and
                        each key-value pair in a hash to be iterated.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Combined Comparison Operator</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, the combined comparison operator, &lt;=&gt;,
                        also known as the spaceship operator is used to compare
                        two objects. It returns 0 if the first operand equals
                        the second, 1 if the first operand is greater than the
                        second, and -1 if the first operand is less than the
                        second.

                      <h2>Ruby method</h2>
                      <p>
                        A Ruby method is a reusable section of code written to
                        execute a certain task. It is defined with the def
                        keyword, followed by a method name, a method body, and
                        ends with the end keyword:

                      <h2>Ruby Block</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, a block is a section of code defined within the
                        keywords do and end or with curly braces {}. This is
                        usually preceded by an integer followed by .times to
                        indicate how many times the code is to be executed.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Return</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, the return keyword is used to pass back a value
                        from a method.
                      </p>

                      <h2>Ruby Method Parameters & Arguments</h2>
                      <p>
                        In Ruby, parameters are placeholders for real values or
                        arguments passed into a method when it is called. When
                        calling a method that requires parameters, arguments
                        (ie. real values) must be passed in for those
                        parameters.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        In a Ruby method, a splat (*) operator is used to
                        indicate that a parameter can have an unknown number of
                        arguments.
